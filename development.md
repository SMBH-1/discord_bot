# Development Recommendations

### Team Considerations


#### Discord Bot Design
The main project folder will include:

* venv 

* main.py - brings bot online in discord

* bot.py - runs bot, listens for client events, and determines if user message goes to responses.py

* responses.py - includes series of if statements that take in user messages to run matching functions from Responses Folder

* Responses Folder - [include YOUR feature additions here as separate .py files]


#### Implementing Bot Features
